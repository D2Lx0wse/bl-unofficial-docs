Welcome to BONELAB Unofficial Docs site! This is a community ran project that contains information and guides to assist you with creating SDK mods.

These docs will operate under the assumption that you have a Unity project setup with the [Marrow Extended SDK Patch 2](https://github.com/notnotnotswipez/Marrow-ExtendedSDK-PATCH-2) scripts.

> [!INFO] You will find
> - Basic Spawnable Setup
> - ~~Unoffical scripts info/use guides~~ - Until further updates, this will not be worked on, if at all. If you want to do it, you can contribute (See below).
> - UltEvents Logic guides  + Information on how to best utilise the UltEvents package
> - Prefabs (a lot of them) + Modding resources
