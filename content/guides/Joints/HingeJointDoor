title: Hinge Joint Door

### This is a simple guide for using joints to create a door!

## Creating a prefab

Make a prefab for the door, inside, add a GameObject called JointDoor, this will be used for the door itself. 

If you don't have a frame or anything outside the door that isn't supposed to move, you can instead add the following components to the root of the prefab.

Add an InteractableHost, Hinge Joint, and a Rigidbody to the JointDoor GameObject. (Or the root)

## The Rigidbody

You can do whatever you want with this, as the setting vary depending on the type of door you're making.

### The InteractableHost

You can just leave this component alone.

## The Hinge Joint
#### Add any colliders, models, or grips as children under the JointDoor GameObject.

- You can leave the Connected Rigidbody empty, or you can give the root a Rigidbody, set it to Kinematic, and then connect it to that, but as far as I know, there's not much point in doing that.

- The anchor is what the object will rotate around. You'll usually want to set this to the side of the door, assuming it is a similar model to the one in the GIF.

- Set some of these numbers to 0 or 1, using the "Edit Angular Limits" view to see the rotation. It's important you set this correctly.

- At its current settings, the door has no rotation limit; if you want it to stop moving at a specific rotation, check the "Use Limits" toggle. Under "limits," you can adjust it to your desire. Use "Edit Angular Limits" to view the object's limit.

- If you want your door to be breakable, lower "Break Force" and "Break Torque," it will likely be already set to infinity, meaning your door is unbreakable.

#### You can play around with the rest of these settings. Although usually just changing the settings I listed works fine though.
